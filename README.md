# Smart-Sensor-Network-System-For-Structural-Health-Monitoring
An integrated system for real-time monitoring of structural health. The project combines sensor measurements, drone imaging, and machine learning to detect, localize, and analyze cracks. Data from distributed sensors are transmitted over a LoRa network, processed, and visualized for timely maintenance.
